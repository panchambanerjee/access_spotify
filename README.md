# access_spotify

This project is for all the music obsessives out there. 

It will eventually evolve into a package that offers advanced functionality for utilizing the Spotify API. 

Currently, it queries Spotify for the specified artist (default = 'The Beatles' because who else?) and 
downloads all the album art, and all the album audio features and analysis for the artist. 


It is recommended that the user work in their own virtual environment. 

Current usage:

git clone https://github.com/panchambanerjee/access_spotify.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
