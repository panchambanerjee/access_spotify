# access_spotify

This project is for all the music obsessives out there. 

it will eventually evolve into a package that offers advanced functionality for utilizing the Spotify API. Currently, it queries Spotify for the specified artist (default = 'The Beatles' because who else?) and downloads all the album art, and all the album audio features and analysis for the artist.
